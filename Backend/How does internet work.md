At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized protocols. These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely.

The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems. When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.

To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols, including the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination, while TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.

In addition to these core protocols, there are a wide range of other technologies and protocols that are used to enable communication and data exchange over the internet, including the Domain Name System (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol. As a developer, it is important to have a solid understanding of how these different technologies and protocols work together to enable communication and data exchange over the internet.
## Terminology

To understand the internet, it’s important to be familiar with some basic concepts and terminology. Here are some key terms and concepts to be aware of:

- **Packet:** A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.
- **Router:** A device that directs packets of data between different networks.
- **IP Address:** A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination.
- **Domain Name:** A human-readable name that is used to identify a website, such as google.com.
- **DNS:** The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.
- **HTTP:** The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website).
- **HTTPS:** An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.
- **SSL/TLS:** The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet.
## Protocols

Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet. A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how information is exchanged between devices and systems.

There are many different protocols used in internet communication, including the Internet Protocol (IP), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the Domain Name System (DNS), and many others.

IP is responsible for routing packets of data to their correct destination, while TCP and UDP ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and efficiently. DNS is used to translate domain names into IP addresses, and HTTP is used to transfer data between clients and servers.

One of the key benefits of using standardized protocols is that they allow devices and systems from different manufacturers and vendors to communicate with each other seamlessly. For example, a web browser developed by one company can communicate with a web server developed by another company, as long as they both adhere to the HTTP protocol.

As a developer, it’s important to understand the various protocols used in internet communication and how they work together to enable the transfer of data and information over the internet.
